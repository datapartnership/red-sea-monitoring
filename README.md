# Monitoring the Red Sea Shipping Crisis

## Assignment

The Red Sea shipping crisis is a global crisis that began in October 2023, when missile attacks on ships and tankers traversing the Red Sea caused hundreds of vessels to avoid the Suez Canal. The attacks are concentrated near the Bab al-Mandab Strait, a 20-mile-wide chokepoint for maritime traffic.

The World Bank Country Economics teams in Egypt, Yemen, and Djibouti seek to monitor the status and impacts of the crisis on their respective and regional economies. To support these efforts, a Bank team comprised of colleagues from the Data Lab and the Geospatial Operations Support Team (GOST) are using maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, conflict statistics, and cargo flight data to prepare monthly updates on shipping impacts.
