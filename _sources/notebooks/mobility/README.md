## Data

The project team acquired longitudinal human mobility data. The mobility data was provided pro-bono by [Veraset](https://veraset.com) through the proposal [Measure Activity Levels on Tourism Sites Affected by the 2023 Red Sea Crisis](https://portal.datapartnership.org/readableproposal/565) via  the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org). During the project’s execution, [Veraset Movement](https://www.veraset.com/products/movement/)’s global daily data feed was ingested and processed through the [Mobility](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) pipeline maintained by the [Development Data Partnership](https://datapartnership.org/). For additional information, please refer to the [Mobility Documentation](https://docs.datapartnership.org/collections/mobility/README.html) accessible to all World Bank staff.
