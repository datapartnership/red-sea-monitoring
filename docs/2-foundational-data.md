# Datasets: Introduction

Each Data Goods project begins with a survey of existing data resources that can be leveraged to support a project or program. In addition to these existing datasets, advisory is provided on digtizing data may exist in paper records and making existing government data records more discoverable through AI. Also, methods for new data collection, including household surveys, remote sensing, and crowdsourcing are proposed. 

All Bank-produced datasets as part of the Data Good will be hosted as a special collection on the World Bank's Data Catalogue, managed by the Development Economics Data Group (DECDG). The Catalogue receives more than 14 million unique users per month and will ensure value of the investment in data collection will be multiplied.

The following chapters provide additional detail about these services:

- [Existing Data](2a-existing-data.md)
- [Digitized Government Data](2b-digitizing-gov-data.md)
- [New Data Collection](2c-new-data-collection.md)

And the final chapter includes an example of how these resources can come together:
